# hello-world
First repository trying on Github

Hello World, this is my first project
on Github, I'm excited am looking forward
a totally new world.

I'm already thinking about my next move, maybe
use c++ to write a template/class about myself 
and even to achieve some functions.

Recently I'm just starting to learn to c++, even though I had
learned it several years ago, and even built a webseit on a server
established on CentOS.
Now I am focusing on learning deal.II, until now I've learned it for 
3 weeks, I really admire what Wolfgang made, he is a really giant in
my eyes. I hope I would also like him to write or build something
for this world or for my major.
